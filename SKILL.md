# Callback Setup

Identify callback opportunities in content and engineer both the plant (early setup) and payoff (later callback) to create narrative coherence and reward audience attention.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to use this skill for:**
- Creating callbacks that rely on harmful stereotypes or punching down
- Engineering callback structures designed to deceive or manipulate harmfully
- Building callbacks around exploitation or objectification

**Ethical boundaries:**
- Callbacks should enhance comedy or narrative, not enable cruelty
- If the underlying content is harmful, refuse regardless of callback structure requests

---

## When to Use

**Trigger conditions:**
- Content feels episodic or disconnected (isolated bits without coherence)
- Comedy set or script lacks through-line
- User requests "callbacks," "running gags," or "internal references"
- Material has good individual moments but no connective tissue
- Narrative would benefit from rewarding attentive audience
- User says "make it feel more cohesive" or "give it continuity"

**Do NOT use when:**
- Content is too short for callbacks (callbacks need space between plant and payoff)
- Material is intentionally episodic/disconnected by design
- User wants general structure help (use structural editing skills)

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Validation |
|-------|----------|-------------|------------|
| `content` | Yes | Script, comedy set, presentation, or multi-part narrative | Must have enough length for callbacks (minimum 3-5 minutes of material) |
| `callback_type` | No | "Comedy" (default), "Narrative," "Thematic," "Character" | Determines callback style and purpose |
| `density` | No | "Light" (1-2 callbacks), "Moderate" (3-5 callbacks), "Heavy" (6+ callbacks) | Default: Moderate |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Callback-Worthy Elements

Analyze content for details that could plant and pay off later:

**Look for:**
- **Distinctive details** - Unusual words, specific objects, particular phrases
- **Character quirks** - Behaviors, verbal tics, perspectives mentioned
- **Thematic elements** - Recurring ideas or concepts
- **Setup potential** - Moments that could gain new meaning later
- **Contradictions** - Early statements that later events could complicate

**Callback-worthy criteria:**
- Specific enough to be memorable
- General enough to recontextualize
- Not obvious (callbacks work best when audience doesn't see them coming)
- Naturally integrated (not forced)

**Output:** List of 8-12 potential callback elements from the content

### Step 2: Select Strategic Callbacks

From the potential elements, choose which to actually use:

**Selection criteria:**
- **Spacing** - Can you get enough distance between plant and payoff? (Minimum: 2-3 beats/segments between)
- **Relevance** - Does the callback illuminate something new or just repeat?
- **Payoff potential** - Will the recontextualization create laugh/insight/resonance?
- **Density balance** - Don't overload; respect the density parameter

**For "Comedy" callbacks:**
- Choose elements that can be reframed humorously
- Prefer physical objects or specific phrases over abstract concepts
- Look for ways the callback can be a punchline, not just a reference

**For "Narrative" callbacks:**
- Choose elements that can gain meaning through plot development
- Prefer details that can reveal character or advance story
- Look for thematic resonance, not just repetition

**Output:** 3-8 selected callback opportunities (based on density setting)

### Step 3: Engineer the Plant

Design how to introduce the callback element early:

**Plant principles:**
- **Casual introduction** - Don't flag it as important; hide it in normal flow
- **Natural integration** - Must serve immediate purpose, not just setup future payoff
- **Memorable but not obvious** - Distinctive enough to stick, subtle enough not to telegraph
- **Completeness** - Plant should work on its own, even if payoff never comes

**Plant structure:**
```
[Context that justifies mentioning the element]
[The callback element embedded naturally]
[Immediate purpose that makes the mention logical]
```

**Example:**
Instead of: "My wife - and remember this detail for later - always leaves the lights on..."
Use: "My wife leaves every light in the house on. I come home, it looks like a prison break is happening. Electric company sends me thank you cards."
(The "lights on" detail is planted for later callback, but serves immediate joke)

### Step 4: Engineer the Payoff

Design how to bring the callback back later:

**Payoff principles:**
- **Sufficient distance** - At least 2-3 segments after the plant
- **New context** - Same detail, different situation
- **Recognition reward** - Audience should feel smart for remembering
- **Enhanced meaning** - Payoff should add dimension to the original plant

**Payoff structure:**
```
[New situation or context]
[Callback reference that connects to plant]
[New meaning or punchline that reframes the original]
```

**Callback signal options:**
- **Direct reference:** "Remember those lights I mentioned? Well..."
- **Subtle reference:** Just use the detail without explaining (rewards attentive audience)
- **Recontextualized:** The detail appears in completely new context

**Choose signal based on callback type:**
- Comedy callbacks: Usually subtle (funnier when audience connects it themselves)
- Narrative callbacks: Can be direct or subtle depending on importance
- Thematic callbacks: Often subtle (intellectual satisfaction of recognition)

### Step 5: Mark and Document

Annotate the content with callback architecture:

**Notation system:**
```
[PLANT: callback-identifier] - Marks where element is introduced
[PAYOFF: callback-identifier] - Marks where element returns
[CALLBACK: callback-identifier] - General marker if plant/payoff unclear
```

**Create callback map:**
```
Callback 1: "electric bill"
- Plant: Line 15 (wife leaves lights on joke)
- Payoff 1: Line 87 (electricity metaphor for relationship intensity)
- Payoff 2: Line 142 (final button about still paying her electric bill post-divorce)

Callback 2: "thank you cards"
- Plant: Line 18 (electric company sends thank you cards)
- Payoff: Line 156 (callback to thank you card but from divorce lawyer)
```

**Include:**
- All callback identifiers
- Plant and payoff locations
- Distance between plant and payoff (measured in lines/segments)
- How the meaning reframes

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Content too short for callbacks | Note minimum length requirement; suggest focusing on structure instead |
| No callback-worthy elements found | Material may be too abstract or too uniform; suggest adding distinctive details |
| Callbacks feel forced | Remove or redesign; forced callbacks are worse than no callbacks |
| Too many callbacks (overwhelming) | Reduce to highest-value callbacks; recommend "Light" or "Moderate" density |
| Plant too obvious/telegraphed | Redesign plant to be more casual and naturally integrated |
| Payoff too subtle (audience won't connect) | Add slight signal or direct reference; balance recognition vs. hand-holding |

## Example

**Input content (simplified stand-up set outline):**

```
Opening: Talk about being single again at 40
Bit 1: Dating apps are terrible
Bit 2: Went to wedding, everyone asking when I'll get married
Bit 3: My apartment is a mess, living like a college student
Bit 4: Tried cooking, burned water
Bit 5: Family keeps setting me up on blind dates
Closing: Maybe I'm fine being single
```

**Callback type:** Comedy
**Density:** Moderate (3-5 callbacks)

**Step 1: Potential callback elements identified:**
1. "Single at 40" (thematic)
2. "Dating apps" (specific)
3. "Everyone asking when I'll get married" (situation)
4. "Apartment is a mess" (specific detail)
5. "Living like college student" (comparison)
6. "Burned water" (absurd specific)
7. "Blind dates" (situation)

**Step 2: Selected callbacks:**
1. "Burned water" (absurd, memorable, great payoff potential)
2. "Living like college student" (relatable, can reframe)
3. "Everyone asking when married" (thematic through-line)

**Step 3 & 4: Engineered plants and payoffs:**

**Callback 1: "Burned Water"**

**Plant (Bit 4):**
```
[PLANT: burned-water]
[conversational] I tried cooking last week. Trying to be a responsible adult, right?
[building] Made pasta. You know how easy pasta is? Boil water, add pasta, wait.
[snap] I burned the water. [beat] I don't even know how that's possible, but I did it.
The smoke alarm went off. My neighbor knocked on the door asking if I was okay.
I said, "I'm fine, I'm just boiling water." She looked at me like I was describing a crime.
[let it ride]
```

**Payoff 1 (Bit 5 - Blind date story):**
```
[PAYOFF: burned-water]
So my mom sets me up with her friend's daughter. We go to dinner.
She asks what I like to cook. [beat] I'm thinking, "Should I mention the water incident?"
[snap] I said, "I make a mean bowl of cereal." [let it ride]
```

**Payoff 2 (Closing):**
```
[PAYOFF: burned-water]
Maybe I'm fine being single. I got my freedom, my mess of an apartment,
[callback delivery] and the smoke detector company knows me by name.
[pause] Besides, the world's not ready for what I'd do at a couples' cooking class.
[snap] "Okay everyone, first step: don't burn the water."
[let it ride]
```

**Callback 2: "College Student"**

**Plant (Bit 3):**
```
[PLANT: college-student]
My apartment looks like a college dorm. I got a futon. [beat] I'm 40 with a futon.
I got a poster on the wall—not even framed, just thumbtacks.
My kitchen table is a coffee table I found on the street.
[snap] I'm one pizza box away from being featured on an episode of "Hoarders: The Early Years."
```

**Payoff (Bit 5 - Blind date):**
```
[PAYOFF: college-student]
Worst part of the blind date? She asked if she could see my place.
[pause] I said, "Only if you want to see what happens when IKEA furniture gives up."
[building] She came up anyway. Looked around. [beat] Said, "This is very... college."
[snap] I said, "Thank you! I'm going for 'eternal youth.'" [deadpan] She left.
```

**Callback 3: "When will you get married" (Thematic)**

**Plant (Bit 2):**
```
[PLANT: when-married]
Went to a wedding last month. Every relative: "When's it your turn?"
[acceleration] "You're not getting any younger." "Don't you want kids?" "What about settling down?"
[snap] I said, "I am settled down. I'm sitting right here. I'm very settled."
```

**Payoff (Closing):**
```
[PAYOFF: when-married]
People keep asking when I'll get married.  [beat] Here's my answer:
[measured] When I can cook without adult supervision,
when my apartment doesn't look like a crime scene,
[building] and when I stop introducing myself to women by talking about my failures—
[pause]
[snap, deadpan] So yeah, check back in twenty years.
```

**Callback map:**

```
Callback 1: "Burned Water"
- Plant: Bit 4 (cooking disaster)
- Payoff 1: Bit 5 (blind date question about cooking)
- Payoff 2: Closing (smoke detector knows me / cooking class)
- Distance: Plant to Payoff 1 = 1 bit; Payoff 1 to Payoff 2 = 1 bit
- Enhancement: Creates through-line of domestic incompetence; each payoff adds new dimension

Callback 2: "College Student"
- Plant: Bit 3 (apartment description)
- Payoff: Bit 5 (blind date sees apartment)
- Distance: 2 bits
- Enhancement: Plant establishes detail, payoff shows consequence; validates the absurdity

Callback 3: "When Will You Get Married" (Thematic)
- Plant: Bit 2 (wedding interrogation)
- Payoff: Closing (final answer to the question)
- Distance: 3-4 bits (spans entire set)
- Enhancement: Creates thematic closure; closing answers opening question with callbacks to all the evidence presented
```

**Result:** Set now has coherent through-line. Opening establishes question ("Why am I single at 40?"), middle builds evidence ("I burn water, live like a student, can't date"), closing answers with callbacks that pull the whole set together. Audience rewarded for attention; material feels crafted, not random.

## Integration with Redd Foxx Expert

This skill extracts Foxx's "Callback Setup" technique:

**From Foxx's methodology:**
- "Plant jokes early that pay off later in the set, rewarding attentive audiences"
- "Creating the feeling of an intricately constructed performance, not just random jokes"
- Example from PROMPT: "Mentioning your wife early, then returning to that detail three jokes later with a new twist that reframes the whole setup"

**Foxx's party records** demonstrated callback mastery - in recorded comedy with no visual component, callbacks create the cohesion that makes a side-long album feel like a unified performance rather than disconnected bits. This skill teaches that architecture.

---

## Skill Boundaries

**This skill handles:**
- Identifying callback opportunities in existing content
- Engineering plants and payoffs
- Spacing and density of callbacks
- Creating narrative/comedic coherence through callbacks

**This skill does NOT handle:**
- Writing original content (use comedy writing or drafting skills)
- General structure or organization (use structural editing skills)
- Timing of individual jokes (use timing-architecture)
- Character development (use character-bit-construction)

**When to combine with other skills:**
- Use with `timing-architecture` to properly time both plants and payoffs
- Use with `blue-material-craft` when callbacks involve adult material
- Use with `character-bit-construction` when callbacks are character-based

---

**Remember:** The best callbacks feel inevitable in retrospect but surprising in the moment. Plant casually, pay off strategically, and reward the audience's attention.
